<p>Different types:A daily wager is only employed for the duration of that day, and his services may be terminated at the end of that day.
A review of the aforementioned decisions would simply explain the entire scope of the idea of a ‘daily wager.’ To recap, a daily wager is a person who is employed by an employer on a day-to-day basis, meaning that his employment begins at the start of the day and ends at the end of the day, with pay accruing at the end of each day’s work. As a result, neither the employer nor the employee is obligated to continue working after that day, even if the employer requests it. The employee and the worker do not have a contract of employment in place, and they are not on the company’s muster roster.
